          Perfume is a fragrant liquid made from essential oils, aroma
          compounds, and solvents. It is used to give a pleasant scent to the
          body, clothes, or surroundings.

            Perfume should be applied to pulse points such as the wrists, neck,

            longer-lasting scent.

            Fragrance notes are the different layers of scent in a perfume,
            including top notes, middle (heart) notes, and base notes that
            appear over time.

            ></span>
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            Eau de Parfum has a higher concentration of fragrance oils and lasts
            longer, while Eau de Toilette is lighter and more suitable for
            everyday use.

          <div class="answer">
            The longevity of a perfume depends on its concentration,
            ingredients, and skin type, but most perfumes last between 4 to 8
            hours.
